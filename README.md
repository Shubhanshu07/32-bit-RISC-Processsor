# 32-bit-RISC-Processsor
The microprocessor has wide application and impact in various working procedures of almost
all sectors. From a small wristwatch to large computational systems used in Research
laboratories, microprocessors are used everywhere, ranging from small microcontrollers to
general purpose 64-bit microprocessors. This is a trending and fast-changing technology with
a lot of scope of research and development as well as developing and improving the existing
technologies. 
The high-end (32 and 64-bit) general purpose microprocessor are divided into two distinct
design philosophies:
- CISC (Complex Instruction Set Architecture)
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture)

As the processor technology began to develop from a 4-bit processor to 64-bit processor, there
always has been an objective to increase the number of instructions handled by the processor.
With the increase in number of instructions, the control unit and instruction decoder became
more complex and occupied 50-60 percent of the memory. Thus, the research interest shifted
to the development of reduced instructions so as to increase the speed of execution. The RISC
processors were then developed to simplify hardware design and improve processor
performance.

Some features of RISC processor development philosophy:
- Less number of instructions (upto 100)
- Less number of addressing modes
- Memory referencing is reduced
- Support more number of registers (32 to 100) rather than memory
- Simplified instruction format with execution in one cycle
- Support for high level languages 

CISC on the other hand performs multiple tasks with a single instruction.
MIPS stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stage. It has wide application in
the development of embedded systems such as video games, digital television, etc. They
provide better performance with low power consumption.

## Conclusion
Our processor is able to handle 16 different instructions with in-order dual issue and
execution. The synchronization using single cycle datapath is able to execute all R-type, I-type,
J-type formats, which are extended to Superscalar datapath. Moreover, the processor can
work on negative values. An assembler is developed so that one does not need to enter
machine coded instruction in the Verilog program. The concepts of Datapath, Superscalar
implementation, different issue policies and dependencies were understood. Customized 32-
bit MIPS processor has increased our understanding of the field computer architecture
significantly. It has taught us work ethics and teamwork.
